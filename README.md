<h1>Strengthening Cloud Data Security and Compliance</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I identified repeated unauthorized access attempts against our cloud-based customer database containing personal and financial data. This posed high risks of data breach, regulatory fines (GDPR/CCPA), reputational damage, and operational disruption.

<h2>Assessment</h2>
Risk rated High (Likelihood: Medium–High, Impact: High–Critical). Existing safeguards included role-based access, encryption, monitoring, patching, and segmentation, but these were insufficient for persistent cloud threats.

<h2>Actions Proposed </h2>

- **MFA:** Immediate rollout for stronger authentication.<br>
- **CSPM:** Detect and fix misconfigurations in real time.<br>
- **PAM:** Tighter control of privileged accounts.<br>
- **UEBA:** Detect abnormal access behavior.<br>
- **Penetration Testing:** Independent validation of cloud security.<br>
- **Awareness Training:** Quick refresher to reduce human error.

<h2>Outcome </h2>

I delivered a layered risk reduction plan balancing cost, feasibility, and compliance. Immediate steps (MFA, training) strengthened defenses quickly, while medium- to long-term measures (PAM, CSPM, UEBA) aligned security with regulatory expectations and improved resilience against evolving threats.
