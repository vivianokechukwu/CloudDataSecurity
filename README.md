<h1>Data Breach Risk Assessment for a Financial Firm</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I identified repeated unauthorized access attempts against a cloud-based customer database containing personal and financial data. This posed high risks of data breach, regulatory fines (GDPR/CCPA), reputational damage, and operational disruption.

<h2>Assessment</h2>
The risk was rated High (Likelihood: Medium–High, Impact: High–Critical).<br> 
Existing controls: role-based access, encryption, monitoring, patching, and segmentation were in place but proved insufficient against persistent cloud threats.


<h2>Actions Proposed </h2>

- MFA: Rolled out immediately to strengthen authentication<br>
- CSPM: Implemented to detect and remediate misconfigurations in real time<br>
- PAM: Introduced tighter controls over privileged accounts<br>
- UEBA: Deployed to detect abnormal access behavior<br>
- Penetration Testing: Conducted independent validation of cloud security<br>
- Awareness Training: Delivered refresher sessions to reduce human error

<h2>Outcome </h2>
I delivered a layered risk reduction plan that balanced cost, feasibility, and compliance. Immediate measures (MFA, training) strengthened defenses quickly, while medium to long-term initiatives (PAM, CSPM, UEBA) aligned security with regulatory requirements and improved resilience against evolving threats.
